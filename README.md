This program leverages the capabilities of libraries such as fbprophet for time series forecasting, Streamlit for interactive web applications, and Yahoo Finance for fetching financial data. Its core functionality revolves around stock market prediction, involving the estimation of future values for company stocks and other exchange-traded financial instruments. Employing Machine Learning (ML) methodologies, particularly LSTM and RNN models, this ongoing project aims to analyze extensive datasets, ensuring a high degree of predictive accuracy. Algorithmic trading, enabled by this approach, has gained significant traction in recent years due to its capacity to process vast amounts of data beyond human capabilities.
